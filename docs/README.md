# OctoAcme — Project Management Processes (Overview)

OctoAcme runs projects using an iterative, outcomes-driven approach that emphasizes clear ownership, frequent feedback, and measurable success. Projects start with a lightweight Project One‑pager to capture the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial risks. Once initiated, teams move into planning to decompose work into shippable increments, create a prioritized backlog, estimate scope, and define a clear Definition of Done.

Execution follows a predictable backlog-to-release pipeline using a project board with columns such as Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done. Developers follow a CI-first PR workflow (small PRs, issue links, acceptance criteria, automated tests and linting, and at least one approval). Team rhythm includes daily standups, a weekly delivery sync, sprint demos, and regular PM+PdM alignment to keep work visible and dependencies managed.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks and communications; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria; Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Risk management uses a simple Risk Register (ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation) reviewed at weekly syncs and escalated along a defined path when necessary.

Quality assurance is layered: unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for acceptance where needed. Releases follow a checklist (CI passing, release notes, rollback plan, smoke tests) and an incident/rollback playbook.
